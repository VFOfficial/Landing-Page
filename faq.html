                                    <p>At Venus Funded, we provide traders with the freedom to choose their trading styles and strategies without any restrictions. However, it is essential to adhere to our terms and avoid any activities that exploit the system or violate fair trading practices. Please take note of the following prohibited actions: It is prohibited to:</p>
                                    <p>(1) Utilize software, artificial intelligence, ultra-high-speed techniques, or mass data entry methods that may manipulate, abuse, or provide an unfair advantage when using our systems or services.</p>
                                    <p>(2) Perform trades in a manner that contradicts how trading is typically conducted in the forex market or any other financial market, or in a way that raises justified concerns about potential financial or other harm to the provider resulting from the customer's activities.</p>
                                    <p>(3) Conduct trades that contradict the terms and conditions of the provider and the trading platform.</p>
                                    <p>(4) Execute trades using an external or slow data feed.</p>
                                    <p>(5) Knowingly or unknowingly use trading strategies that exploit errors in the services, such as price display errors or delayed updates.</p>
                                    <p>(6) Engage in trades, either individually or in collaboration with others, with the intent to manipulate trading, such as entering into simultaneous opposite positions.</p>
                                    <p>(7) Hedging different accounts with other Evaluation firms similar to Venus Funded.</p>

                                    <p>Account Management Services: All accounts participating in our challenges must be exclusively traded by the account owner without any changes once a phase has been completed. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered a violation of the account’s terms. Additionally, one household and one IP address should equal one trader. Failure to adhere to this rule will result in a breach of all accounts across all parties involved.</p>
                                    <p>Prohibited Trading Practices & Group Trading: Group trading is not allowed, so you cannot copy trade from other people as well as group up and reverse trade with each other.</p>
                                    <p>High-frequency trading: A type of algorithmic trading in which large volumes of positions are traded automatically at very high speeds in a matter of seconds.</p>
                                    <p>News scalping: involves rapidly opening and closing multiple positions within seconds, particularly during high-impact news releases such as FOMC, NFP, CPI, and others. It is important to note that engaging in news scalping is prohibited only when it is intentionally exploiting the market feed.</p>
                                    <p>Arbitrage (reverse and latency): Arbitrage trading is not allowed strictly and any accounts will be breached.</p>
                                    <p>Multi-account reverse trading: Reverse trading would be FOMC is about to come out, you buy 50 lots on Venus Funded and you sell 50 lots on some other Evaluation firm. Multi-account reverse trading is not allowed even if both accounts are with Venus Funded.</p>
                                    <p>Tick scalping: Scalping in ticks which is impossible to copy on live data if the firm chooses to do so. Example: Opening and closing large position sizes and in numbers within seconds is not possible to be mirrored live and results will be different.</p>
                                    <p>Reverse Trading: Reverse trading is the same as multi-reverse trading; it's just that it is focused more on reversing between the Funded Engineer's internal accounts. Example: both the accounts are with the Venus Funded.</p>
                                    <p>Copying Trades: Group hedging, which involves individuals coordinating opposing positions across one or multiple Evaluation firms to manipulate risk, is strictly prohibited.</p>
                                    <p>Purchasing or providing account management services or engaging in Evaluation firm passing services is strictly prohibited.</p>
                                    <p>Sharing your account information or allowing someone else to pass an account on your behalf is not allowed, and any violations will result in the loss of all involved accounts.</p>

                <p>Before participating in the Venus Funded proprietary trading program, it is important that you carefully consider the risks associated with trading financial instruments. Trading involves the potential for both significant profits and losses, and it may not be suitable for all individuals. This Risk Disclosure is intended to help you understand and assess these risks before deciding to participate in our program.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Website service utilizes virtual accounts only.</strong> Accordingly, all information provided on this site is intended solely for only educational purposes related to trading on the financial markets and does not serve as specific investment advice, business recommendation, investment analysis or similar general recommendation regarding the trading of any investment instruments.
                <p><strong>Simulated or hypothetical performance</strong></p>   
                <p><strong>Unlike an actual performance record or live trading, simulated results and trading do not represent actual trading. As the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, slippage and similar.</strong></p>
                <p>For clarification purposes, please note that throughout all phases of any cooperation with Instant Funding, we only provide Virtual accounts.</p>
                <p>The leverage involved in trading CFDs means that both gains and losses are magnified. In other words, a relatively small market movement can lead to a proportionately larger movement in the value of your investment; this can work against you as well as for you. The 'leverage' involved in trading CFDs means that a small initial margin payment can potentially lead to significant losses.</p>
                <p>Derivative markets can be highly volatile.</p>
                <p>The prices of the underlying securities, currencies, commodities, financial instruments or indices may fluctuate rapidly, over wide ranges and in reflection of unforeseen events or changes in conditions, none of which are within your control. It will also be influenced by unpredictable events, including but not limited to:, changing supply and demand relationships, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events, and the prevailing psychological characteristics of the relevant marketplace.</p>
                <p>Foreign markets will involve different risks to domestic markets.</p>
                <p>The potential for profit or loss from CFDs relating to a foreign market or denominated in a foreign currency will be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. It is possible to incur a loss if exchange rates change to your detriment, even if the price of the instrument to which the CFD relates remains unchanged.</p>
                <p>By participating in our proprietary trading program, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted the risks outlined in this Risk Disclosure. You agree to assume full responsibility for your trading decisions and acknowledge that Venus Funded is not liable for any losses incurred as a result of trading activities.</p>
