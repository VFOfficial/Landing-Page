                <p>Before participating in the Venus Funded proprietary trading program, it is important that you carefully consider the risks associated with trading financial instruments.

                <p><strong>Simulated or hypothetical performance</strong></p>   
                <p><strong>Unlike an actual performance record or live trading, simulated results and trading do not represent actual trading.

                <p>The leverage involved in trading CFDs means that both gains and losses are magnified. In other words, a relatively small market movement can lead to a proportionately larger movement in the value of your investment; this can work against you as well as for you. The 'leverage' involved in trading CFDs means that a small initial margin payment can potentially lead to significant losses.</p>
                <p>Derivative markets can be highly volatile.</p>
                <p>The prices of the underlying securities, currencies, commodities, financial instruments or indices may fluctuate rapidly, over wide ranges and in reflection of unforeseen events or changes in conditions, none of which are within your control. It will also be influenced by unpredictable events, including but not limited to:, changing supply and demand relationships, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events, and the prevailing psychological characteristics of the relevant marketplace.</p>
                <p>Foreign markets will involve different risks to domestic markets.</p>
                <p>The potential for profit or loss from CFDs relating to a foreign market or denominated in a foreign currency will be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. It is possible to incur a loss if exchange rates change to your detriment, even if the price of the instrument to which the CFD relates remains unchanged.</p>
